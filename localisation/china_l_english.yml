 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nominal unified China is feeble and divided. While Japanes threatening the northern border and an immient war seems inevitable, the internal war has shown no sign of ending and keeps tearing the country apart. Seeking help from both USSR and the Reich, China's stance will not only tip off the balance of the existing world order but also its own future. \n\nHowever, 4 billions Chinese people had never given up and never will. China is at a crossroad and wherever it leads, China will not perish without a fight and will seek its rightful position in the world."

 reorganize_nra_desc:0 "The past decades of civil war was the result of government's loose control of the army. The time has come to unite all the nominal National Revolution Army under one banner."
 employ_western_officers_desc:0 "The hundred year of struggle has taught us that we can't win a war by merely quantity. Even though we have nearly one million soliders, they are poorly trained and supplied. It is urgent to learn from the western at the moment."
 continue_sino_german_cooperation_desc:0 "Germany was defeated in the Great War, however its military genius didn't get wiped out. The development of Zhongzheng Rifle is a great success under the Sino-German Cooperation and we should extend our cooperation for even more."
 ussr_support_desc:0 "Red Army has been growing up fast ever since its establishment and their development of equiment and tanks is surely something we can learn from. We had a cooperation in 1920s but that one didn't end up in betrayal and blood. However at this moment, even at the risk of importing communism, we need their help to defend ourselves against the Japanese invaders."
 democratic_armory_desc:0 "Traders from democratic countries are fair, they don't care about your cause as long as you pay. Since several staffs of our government has connections with the US and British government, maybe we can get a fair deal from them."
 extend_terms_desc:0 "The Sino-German cooperation was a success, but like all good things, it has to come to an end. However if we sent out a proposal of extending the terms, they may accept. Meanwhile we have to offer something they would find hard to reject - a reliable and strong ally in Asia."
 restablish_united_front_desc:0 "Ever since regaining the support from USSR, our officers and soliders have learned a lot. However Stalin insist that our leader have to negotiate a peace with communist rebels if we want them to continue supporting us. And since Japan is the biggest problem now, maybe it's beneficial to unite the communist again just like we did before. For the future of Chinese people, we are planning a bold visit to Xi'an."
 arms_trade_desc:0 "The arms trade with democratic countries grants us access to world best weaponry and technology. However, they didn't come without a political purpose as we expected. After we suggested an extension of the trade, they proposed a counter offer that a reorganize NRA equipped with their weapons should be obligated to protect their colonies in Asia in the future."
 independent_development_desc:0 "The help of Westerns boosted our development, however it's the time for the coopertaion to come to an end. They are requesting more and more politic promise and favours in return and we can't continue with such a risk. Without their support, we may have a hard time developing on our own. But China's fate should be and will be decided by its own people!"
 tsingtao_cooperation_company_desc:0 "To deepen our cooperation, German experts suggested us to found a official cooperation company in their old colony - Tsingtao, so we can work without harassment from Japan's military presence. More and more Germans are arriving at the city, either to work or to get drunk with Tsingtao beer. And a team of german oil experts are exploring on the Bohai Sea for months, we should hear from them soon."
 nanchang_mineral_company_desc:0 "Soviet experts always has the best sense of smell for the resource. Recently, a vast deposit of rare minerals has been detected by a Soviet exploration team in Jiangxi. If we found a mineral company with the help of soviet technology, soon we will have enough raw material to build a fully modernized army all by ourselves."
 xiamen_trade_company_desc:0 "Western merchants are suggesting that we found a government own company in Hainan for even wider international trade. And they are also willing to invest for dock and factory construction for bigger cargo capacity. Not like any unequal treaties we are force to sign in the past, this time it may be a win-win for both sides."
 chengdu_industry_bureau_desc:0 "After the withdrawn of all the foreign experts and millitary staffs, our military and industry are suffering a chaotic transformation. We have to establish a official bureau to reorganize all the production and resource. Chengdu would be a great chance since its strategic importance and vast natural resource."
 research_capacity_desc:0 "Our nation has grown a lot in the last few years. We have more scientists and enigneers than any time we did in the history. We should put our research focus on much more and complicated projects now."
 sino_luftwaffe_desc:0 "German superior airforce is somthing they are proud of. And as China is their faithful ally in the Asia, they have shared their advanced air technology and strategy with us. Now with the help of German engineers, we will build our own air force!"
 steel_of_the_repulic_desc:0 "Soviets are innovative in tank designs. Their tanks are cheap but powerful. And with the growth of our own industry power, developing our own tank should be put on schedule. Soviet has promised us to share their newest technology with us and our engineers are already in positions."
 revisit_our_sea_desc:0 "Ever since Zhenghe has returned from his great expeditions, our fleets has been blocked by our own ports and minds. And now facing the increasing threat of Japanese navy presence in the Pacific, the Allies are encouraging us to build our own navy forces to cooperate with them. Our engineers are already studying their shared blueprints."
 whampoa_rifle_desc:0 "Since now we have no technology support from foregin engineers, we have to develop new weaponry on our own. It may be wise for us to start with small equipments such as rifles. Our engineers have already gathered in Whampoa to deign the new standard rifle for the NRA."
