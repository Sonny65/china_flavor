 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nominal unified China is feeble and divided. While Japanes threatening the northern border and an immient war seems inevitable, the internal war has shown no sign of ending and keeps tearing the country apart. Seeking help from both USSR and the Reich, China's stance will not only tip off the balance of the existing world order but also its own future. \n\nHowever, 4 billions Chinese people had never given up and never will. China is at a crossroad and wherever it leads, China will not perish without a fight and will seek its rightful position in the world."

 reorganize_nra_desc:0 "The past decades of civil war was the result of government's loose control of the army. The time has come to unite all the nominal National Revolution Army under one banner."
 employ_western_officers_desc:0 "The hundred year of struggle has taught us that we can't win a war by merely quantity. Even though we have nearly one million soliders, they are poorly trained and supplied. It is urgent to learn from the western at the moment."
 continue_sino_german_cooperation_desc:0 "Germany was defeated in the Great War, however its military genius didn't get wiped out. The development of Zhongzheng Rifle is a great success under the Sino-German Cooperation and we should extend our cooperation for even more."
 ussr_support_desc:0 "Red Army has been growing up fast ever since its establishment and their development of equiment and tanks is surely something we can learn from. We had a cooperation in 1920s but that one didn't end up in betrayal and blood. However at this moment, even at the risk of importing communism, we need their help to defend ourselves against the Japanese invaders."
 democratic_armory_desc:0 "Traders from democratic countries are fair, they don't care about your cause as long as you pay. Since several staffs of our government has connections with the US and British government, maybe we can get a fair deal from them."
 extend_terms_desc:0 "The Sino-German cooperation was a success, but like all good things, it has to come to an end. However if we sent out a proposal of extending the terms, they may accept. Meanwhile we have to offer something they would find hard to reject - a reliable and strong ally in Asia."
 restablish_united_front_desc:0 "Ever since regaining the support from USSR, our officers and soliders have learned a lot. However Stalin insist that our leader have to negotiate a peace with communist rebels if we want them to continue supporting us. And since Japan is the biggest problem now, maybe it's beneficial to unite the communist again just like we did before. For the future of Chinese people, we are planning a bold visit to Xi'an."
 arms_trade_desc:0 "The arms trade with democratic countries grants us access to world best weaponry and technology. However, they didn't come without a political purpose as we expected. As we suggested an extension of the trade, they proposed a counter offer."
