 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nominal unified China is feeble and divided. While Japanes threatening the northern border and an immient war seems inevitable, the internal war has shown no sign of ending and keeps tearing the country apart. Seeking help from both USSR and the Reich, China's stance will not only tip off the balance of the existing world order but also its own future. \n\nHowever, 4 hundred million Chinese people had never given up and never will. China is at a crossroad and wherever it leads, China will not perish without a fight and will seek its rightful position in the world."

 employ_western_officers_desc:0 "The hundred year of struggle has taught us that we can't win a war by merely quantity. Even though we have nearly one million soldiers, they are poorly trained and supplied. It is urgent to learn from the western at the moment."
 continue_sino_german_cooperation_desc:0 "Germany was defeated in the Great War, however its military genius didn't get wiped out. The development of Zhongzheng Rifle is a great success under the Sino-German Cooperation and we should extend our cooperation for even more."
 ussr_support_desc:0 "Red Army has been growing up fast ever since its establishment and their development of equipment and tanks is surely something we can learn from. We had a cooperation in 1920s but that one didn't end up in betrayal and blood. However at this moment, even at the risk of importing communism, we need their help to defend ourselves against the Japanese invaders."
 democratic_armory_desc:0 "Traders from democratic countries are fair, they don't care about your cause as long as you pay. Since several staffs of our government has connections with the US and British government, maybe we can get a fair deal from them."
 extend_terms_desc:0 "The Sino-German cooperation was a success, but like all good things, it has to come to an end. However if we sent out a proposal of extending the terms, they may accept. Meanwhile we have to offer something they would find hard to reject - a reliable and strong ally in Asia."

 independent_development_desc:0 "The help of Westerns boosted our development, however it's the time for the coopertaion to come to an end.

 xiamen_trade_company_desc:0 "Western merchants are suggesting that we found a government own company in Hainan for even wider international trade.

 chengdu_industry_bureau_desc:0 "After the withdrawn of all the foreign experts and millitary staffs, our military and industry are suffering a chaotic transformation.
